### POST Migrate

Main method that should migrate the data. But due JIRA's API limitations for the migration process, this method just return the data to use with [JIRA's Migration "Wizard"](https://olxbr.atlassian.net/secure/CsvSetupPage!default.jspa?externalSystem=com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jim-plugin%3AcsvImporter&nonImporter=noneOfThese&onboarding=true).
